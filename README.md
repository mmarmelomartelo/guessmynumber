# Guess My Number
## AIMs:
This project aimed to create a simple guessing game that allows the user to discover the secret number generated automatically from 1 to 30. It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The page uses semantic HTML elements and is a responsive website across different screen sizes. A retro design and color palette were chosen for this game to allow the user to remember the 80s decade. The main aim is to guess the correct number generate by the app.
